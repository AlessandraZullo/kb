hijack data w/out knwoing the pin (after phone is pin-unlocked, or used to do it by loading custom boot rom, get enc keys and bf, but since ios 4 hasnt been any boot rom to do that)
expl: fake charger
ie. it's harder but not impossible

apps can read certains files outside sandbox

signature (ensure integrity of app):
to run, an app must be signed by apple or cert issued by apple
plus runtime checks to test the integrity (ios apple security pdf + bh 2012 talk)

jailbreak the device to run unsigned code

obj-c
native apps are written in obj-c
obj-c == c + smalltalk-stule messaging and object syntax
ojb-c is a strict superset of c
  - cancompile c w/ obj-c compile
  - c code can be included in obj-c code

class methods and instance methods

automatic reference counting (optional but enabled by default) aka. ARC

instance variables == properties + accessor methods generated auto at compile time
property can be declared as readonly, assign, copy, retain

cocoa = framework and APIs, UI functionality etc.

xcode is apple's IDE (free to download from appstore)

* pentest env.
ssh over usb!

all ios device will run ios6 or above

jailbreak:
as a dev you should assume that your app will run on a compromised device

do not update test devices
Cydia: .deb based software repo for jailbroken devices
iphone-tunnel: ssh over usb
mobilesubstrate: patching code at runtime

to install AppCrack: need to add root repository to Cydia 
AppCrack sometimes doesnt work, need to retry
wont work if app has anti-debugging protections

application id is random (GUID)

pasteboard
/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.UIKit.pboard/pasteboardDB

request/response cache
Library/Caches/com.flexteam/Cache.db*

logging
here until next reboot

app always 1 binary
binary can contain more than 1 arch like (arm6 and arm7)

* cyscript

UIApp.keyWindow # get the main window
UIApp.keyWindow.rootViewController

search for Delegate

ps aux | grep goMoney
cycript -p <pid>
UIApp.delegate
*UIApp.delegate
[UIApp.delegate informUserOfJailbrokenDevice] # triggers the pop up

[login fakeSignIn] # execute the method

# reverse eng toolkit
iRET

CocoaPods is a depedency manager for Cocoa projects / used to install and manage dependencies in existing Xcode projects
Carthage is a decentralised dependency manager for Cocoa application (i.e. alternative to CocoaPods)
